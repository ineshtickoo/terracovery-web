        <h1>The Problem</h1>
        <p>
          Desertification is a broad term that incorporates a variety of
          processes, other concepts, drivers, and solutions, as well as people
          from varied backgrounds and interests (farmers, scientists,
          policymakers, and so on). With all of their (internal) feedback and
          interrelationships, these concerns are still not fully understood. As
          a result, it is impossible to provide a comprehensive overview of
          desertification and its consequences.

          TerraCovery aims to Identify, Cure and Prevent desertification and
          soil degradation around the world by providing legible solutions that
          are the the best fit for the topography of that area. Our services use
          high-end deep learning techniques to identify and predict potential
          desertification areas and help curb this problem before any major
          effects happen on the soil.
